Neuroanatomy for Neuroimagers: Bringing a systems-level perspective to neuroimaging analyses,"Sofie Valk, Casey Paquola, Maedbh King, Andreas Horn",Mac Shine,"**The human brain is comprised of numerous circuits and systems that together interact to form the basis of cognitive function. While we have a variety of techniques to measure these patterns of organization, an appreciation of the basic neuroanatomical principles that together form the central nervous system is critical for understanding the complex patterns that we observe in our neuroimaging data. This workshop will introduce attendees to the basic organizational structure of the human brain. We will present neuroanatomical principles at both the systems and circuit level. Upon completion, attendees will have obtained a better understanding of the functional organization of the human brain, how it has been shaped over evolutionary time, and how the different neuroimaging signals from their experiments may relate to the underlying neuroanatomy. The flexibility of this topic means that attendees will develop insight into how to interpret diverse kinds of neuroimaging data, ranging from non-invasive structural and functional MRI or M/EEG in humans, to tract-tracing, at the systems and circuit level**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1031_Sy_Bring.pdf?alt=media&token=6a0a76f9-a6fa-4687-95c8-84264f3fe724)",20210621,151000,20210621,160000,symposiumhall1,Symposium Hall 1,Africa/Americas/Europe,Symposium,59772186-aeb4-11eb-8336-1e00b921e125,d92cfc30cca911eb868f
Current frontiers in statistical inference for neuroimaging data,"Stephanie Noble, Jeannette Mumford, Jonathan Rosenblatt, Bertrand Thirion",Bertrand Thirion,"**Brain imaging relies extensively on statistical procedures. Misuse of statistics is a widespread issue in the field. A critical view on statistical procedures is always needed. While basic brain mapping procedures were set up 25 years ago and have progressively improved since then, new approaches have appeared. These novel approaches are an important opportunity for OHBM participants. As part of the session, we will have a discussant that will launch the discussion and help framing questions.

OHBM-DGKN Alliance: International Symposium on Network Reorganization after Stroke,"Christian Grefkes, Adrian Guggisberg, Steven Small, Nick Ward","Christian Grefkes, Steven Small","**Stroke is a leading cause of acquired, permanent disability worldwide. Although the treatment of acute stroke has been improved considerably, the majority of patients to date are left disabled with a relevant impact on functional independence and quality of life. The most critical driver of functional recovery post-stroke is neural reorganization. Here, neuroimaging techniques like fMRI and EEG have considerably advanced the understanding of the mechanisms engaged in neural reorganization and recovery of function. This symposium provides a comprehensive overview on recent developments in the field of stroke recovery using neuroimaging and non-invasive brain stimulation. Novel techniques like dynamic functional connectivity mappings, concurrent TMS-EEG assessments as well as fMRI- and EEG-based network parameter estimates allow new insights into how a stroke lesion interferes with the functional integrity of different systems of the brain. Likewise, the combination of neuroimaging and neurostimulation techniques allows a better understanding of how brain plasticity can be modulated in order to promote the reorganization of neural networks. The symposium will also highlight important caveats and limitations of current models, and finally close with possible solutions and future directions.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1075_Sy_DGKN.pdf?alt=media&token=253c0fd3-9a1f-4353-8ad7-0d4131568e17)",20210621,231000,20210622,0,symposiumhall2,Symposium Hall 2,Americas/Asia/Australia,Symposium,597806b4-aeb4-11eb-97b0-1e00b921e125,d93811cccca911eb878c
Advances in functional neuroimaging of spontaneous thought,"Choong-Wan Woo, Adam Turnbull, Matthias Mittner, Aaron Kucyi","Aaron Kucyi, Julia Kam, Jonathan Smallwood","**Understanding the neural basis of spontaneous thought is an emerging question in contemporary cognitive neuroscience, which cuts across two of the most important issues facing the human brain mapping community. First, different features of ongoing experience emerge consistently at rest, making it critical to understand how these states contribute to measures in resting state analyses as currently performed. Second, contemporary studies highlight that the default mode network is a core feature of many different patterns of ongoing experience. Accordingly, a better understanding of spontaneous thought will inform both neural and cognitive perspectives on the role of the default mode network in human cognition. Our symposium will highlight important perspectives on both a dominant methodology (resting state) and a critical question regarding neural function (the default mode network). Attendees will learn how state-of-the-art analyses, such as predictive modeling and unsupervised learning, as well as experimental approaches that account for psychological context, reveal the neural bases of spontaneous thought.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1022_Sy_Advances.pdf?alt=media&token=01ef6511-828b-42bb-a2e7-b20030369bdc)",20210621,231000,20210622,0,symposiumhall3,Symposium Hall 3,Americas/Asia/Australia,Symposium,59780d4c-aeb4-11eb-936e-1e00b921e125,d9386f34cca911eba84e
Diversity Symposium: Racial Bias in Neuroscience,"Sharlene Newman, Sade Abiodun, Yakeel Quiroz","Rosanna Olsen, AmanPreet Badhwar, Lucina Uddin","**OHBM initially launched a Diversity and Gender Task Force in 2017 to address the growing need to recognize and address multiple forms of inequity with respect to gender balance and geographical representation on the Council (https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/blog/you-spoke-we-l istened-steering-a-new-course-with-respect-to-g ender-equity). Since 2017, this initiative has worked towards tackling a range of issues surrounding underrepresentation at OHBM. The task force has grown and evolved into a Diversity and Inclusion Committee (https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/gender--diversity-committee.html) that meets regularly to ensure that the needs of the diverse OHBM community are adequately represented at all levels of the organization and in all of its activities. As neuroscientists, the OHBM community increasingly recognizes that some groups are historically marginalized in ways that ultimately hinder both social and scientific progress. One way to combat these issues is to expose them and openly discuss ways to address them. This third Diversity Round Table follows up on the success of our inaugural symposium in 2019 focusing on gender biases in academia (https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm/courses/12238/sections/15843/video_presentations/137799) and the second virtual symposium in 2020 focusing on neuroscience and the LGBTQ+ community (https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/blog/ohbm-2020-diversity-round-table-intersection-between-neuroscience-and-the-lgbtq-community). The goal of the 2021 symposium is to facilitate productive discussions on how racial biases affect neuroscience research as well as neuroscientists of color. This is one of many actions we have planned to pursue as outlined in our statement following the murder of George Floyd (https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/blog/ohbm-statement-george-floyd-and-black-lives-matter). **\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1057_Sy_Diversity.pdf?alt=media&token=00d07098-1053-4b9a-b432-0afa621fffd4)",20210621,231000,20210622,0,symposiumhall4,Symposium Hall 4,Americas/Asia/Australia,Symposium,597813f4-aeb4-11eb-ae28-1e00b921e125,d938c83acca911ebb22c

INS-fMRI: a method for mapping mesoscale connectomes in nonhuman primates,Anna Wang Roe,Randy Gollub,"![Anna Wang Roe](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fphotos%2FAnnaWangRoe.png?alt=media&token=e004642a-44cb-4aa7-8363-2291f1d7c76b)\n**Dr. Anna Wang Roe** (B.A. Harvard 1984, PhD MIT 1991) is the Director of the Interdisciplinary Institute of Neuroscience and Technology at Zhejiang University (www.ZIINT.zju.edu.cn). She is known for her studies in visual and somatosensory processing in primate cerebral cortex and for her development of multimodal neurotechnologies.  Her doctoral work under Dr. Mriganka Sur on the 'rewired ferret' preparation is a well-known paradigm for studying brain development and plasticity. As a postdoctoral fellow under Dr. Daniel Ts'o and Torsten Wiesel (Rockefeller University, Baylor College of Medicine), she applied intrinsic signal optical imaging methods to elucidate the organization of area V2 (the second visual cortical area) of the primate. Her first faculty appointment at Department of Neurobiology at Yale University produced a series of studies in which visual illusions were used to differentiate the roles of visual areas V1 and V2. She continued her pioneering work on primate cortex at Vanderbilt University (Professor in Psychology, Radiology, and Biomedical Engineering), and developed integrated approaches (anatomy, electrophysiology, optical imaging, fMRI, optogenetics, near infrared laser stimulation, behavior) to address questions on cortical organization. Her subsequent work at Oregon National Primate Research Center at OHSU focused on postnatal development of foveal vision. She is now full-time at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China and is pursuing the project ‘Columnar Connectome in Macaque monkeys’, a project she hopes will bring understanding of the architectural basis of intelligent systems. She has published over 120 peer-reviewed articles, organized numerous international conferences and symposia, and actively participates in review panels and editorships. In recognition for her contributions, she has received Sloan, Whiltehall, Packard Fellowships and has been elected member of the International Neuropsychological Symposium, as well as SPIE Fellow and AAAS Fellow.\n**Connectome projects have contributed enormously to our understanding of network-based brain function. Here, we present a novel method for establishing mesoscale connectomes in the macaque monkey, which utilizes focal (~0.5mm) near infrared stimulation and ultrahigh field fMRI. Connections are acquired rapidly, at large scale, and in vivo within single individual monkeys. Results from studies of cerebral cortex and amygdala are presented. These high spatial resolution roadmaps represent a conceptual change in our understanding of the structure and function of the brain and will significantly impact brain science, precision medicine, and AI.**",20210622,141000,20210622,150000,mainauditorium,Main Auditorium,Africa/Americas/Europe,Keynote,597663a4-aeb4-11eb-b254-1e00b921e125,d9469654cca911eb9ecb

"Imaging the Brainstem: Approaches, Challenges and Opportunities","Ruud Lucas van den Brink, Jan Willem de Gee, David Clewett, Heidi Jacobs, Veronica Miki-Marttunen","Veronica Mika-Marttunen, Beth Lloyd","**The past few years have witnessed renewed interest in the brainstem within the neuroscientific, neuropsychological and clinical fields. The brainstem hosts multiple structures that constitute key centers for arousal and consciousness, pain, autonomic function, and cortical neuromodulation. Brainstem structures present challenges when assessing their location and activity through neuroimaging methods in humans, making the use of standard preprocessing and analysis toolboxes and pipelines insufficient or inadequate. In spite of this, recent efforts have advanced the field and took it to a point where theoretical or conceptual postulates about the role of brainstem systems can be tested. Improvements in brainstem mapping have the potential to lead to a better understanding of its functional interaction with cortical systems, its relation to physiological signatures, its involvement in higher-order functions, and its prominent role in multiple psychiatric and neurological conditions. This symposium intends to give an overview of technical and neuroscientific state-of-the-art of brainstem imaging work by experts who have intensely researched brainstem systems in humans, with a particular focus on neuromodulatory systems. The program includes topics such as: technical approaches to the imaging of small structures, opportunities offered by high-field MRI, promises of brainstem-specific measures as biomarkers in brain disorders, assessment of brainstem nuclei activity during cognitive processes, and use of ocular measures to inform brainstem structures mapping. The symposium puts the brainstem in the spotlight and is intended for everyone who is interested in unveiling the brainstem’s fascinating mysteries.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1025_Sy_Imaging.pdf?alt=media&token=f0ad233f-472d-4a70-99d5-21068c185a02)",20210622,151000,20210622,160000,symposiumhall1,Symposium Hall 1,Africa/Americas/Europe,Symposium,59781ad2-aeb4-11eb-973c-1e00b921e125,d946ef9ecca911eba639
Learning from high-dimensional neuroimaging data,"Jae-Joong Lee, Qunfang Long, Robyn Miller, Jing Sui","Vince Calhoun, Jing Sui","**Current advances in brain imaging technologies have enabled image acquisition at faster rates and with increased resolution. Multiple accessible international brain imaging datasets online also facilitate the generation of neuroimaging big data. Neuroimaging data is itself high dimensional capturing complex spatiotemporal variation across multiple modalities. Learning meaningful summaries from these data using flexible models is a challenging, but critical, endeavor. The extraction of effective biomarkers of both healthy and disordered brains is complex but has the potential to lead to significant impact. This symposium will introduce cutting-edge, machine learning approaches across a transdiagnostic spectrum can be leveraged to (a) reveal connectivity movies - modeling fluidly varying patterns of functional integration for interpretably presenting and analyzing high dimensional dynamic processes via fMRI signal; (b) infer schizophrenia subgroups by subspace analysis that adaptively capture both the temporal and spatial variability of functional networks; (c) explain and estimate individual differences on moment-by-moment ratings of sustained pain based on a connectivity-based neuroimaging biomarker; (d) pinpoint the common and unique neural pathways that underpin similar symptoms across the autism spectrum, and longitudinally predict the risk for mental disorders in healthy adolescents using personality-guided MRI fusion. This symposium will highlight multiple innovative, data-driven frameworks and discuss how they represent a powerful means of extracting useful neural signatures in multiple aspects. Such approaches that try to represent complex change via meaningful data-driven summaries can inform us about the healthy brain as well as provide new insights into the mechanistic understanding of brain disorders.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1077_Sy_Learn.pdf?alt=media&token=a28c76d0-2fdb-4d18-96d5-1f4dc7353904)",20210622,151000,20210622,160000,symposiumhall2,Symposium Hall 2,Africa/Americas/Europe,Symposium,597821a8-aeb4-11eb-ad15-1e00b921e125,d947484ccca911ebacc1

Nevertheless, there are significant social and cultural challenges that perhaps offer the greatest impediment to open science, and which we would like to highlight here. In this symposium, the Open Science SIG examines the successes of open science in the light of the social challenges that open science faces in driving changes in scientific practice. Our chosen format focuses on three main topics: Successes in Open Science; Addressing Inclusivity in Open Science, and Sociocultural Challenges in Open Science, followed by a twenty minute panel discussion that will include additional commentators from Black In Neuro and Queer in Neuro to discuss topics raised in the three talks.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1068_Sy_Addressing.pdf?alt=media&token=b20a6810-fbf1-491f-a6e8-acb4a2b0d307)",20210622,151000,20210622,160000,symposiumhall3,Symposium Hall 3,Africa/Americas/Europe,Symposium,59782874-aeb4-11eb-93c3-1e00b921e125,d947a15ccca911eb9981
PET Imaging of Brain Connectivity: Hype or Future?,"Aldana Lizarraga, Silvia Caminiti, Andreas Hahn, Joana Pereira","Arianna Sala, Igor Yakushev","**In the last decade, brain connectivity has become a dominant concept in neuroscience. Herewith, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has made an essential contribution to the delineation of t he human brain connectome. While fMRI measures neural activity through changes in cerebral blood flow, positron emission tomography (PET) captures relevant biological processes in a more direct way, through the measurement of e.g., glucose metabolism, neurotransmission, and pathological protein aggregation. Emerging evidence indicates that PET is also able to provide valuable insights into brain connectivity. This symposium provides an overview of methods and applications of PET-based connectivity modelling in health and disease, highlighting its advantages and limitations. Given an increasing pool of publicly available PET data, the presented concepts might be of interest to the broad community of MRI researchers. We conclude that along with fMRI and diffusion imaging, PET represents a valuable tool for exploration of brain connectivity.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1062_sy_PETupdate.pdf?alt=media&token=813aba5b-9014-48a0-8d42-6cfe8a052e33)",20210622,151000,20210622,160000,symposiumhall4,Symposium Hall 4,Africa/Americas/Europe,Symposium,59782f40-aeb4-11eb-9db6-1e00b921e125,d947f9aecca911eb9548

How can scientists respond to the climate emergency? A guide from the SEA SIG,"Charlotte Rae, Anne Urai, Adam Aron, Clare Kelly",Charlotte Rae,"**To keep the world at 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels we have a remaining carbon budget of 300 Gt of C02. Yet existing and pledged fossil fuel infrastructure and business-as-usual activities such as large academic meetings already commit us to 842 Gt C02 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1364-3). We either have to do something very dramatic to change our ways, or we have to anticipate a substantially warmer world, perhaps emerging as soon as the 2040s (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07586-5). By that point, the standard operation of our academic fields might be disrupted out of recognition. People are waking up to the growing international consensus that we need urgent action to tackle dangerous climate change and ecosystem degradation; including many of our members, who increasingly recognise that neuroimaging research activities play a part in these crises, from liquid helium extracted through fossil fuel production, to the energy usage of big data analysis. The annual meeting also has a substantial environmental impact, with the huge carbon footprint of flying, and conference centre practises such as single-use plastics. A primary objective of the SEA SIG is to educate our community on the environmental impacts of neuroimaging research activities, and of the annual meeting, and crucially, to foster discussion on, and make recommendations for, how we could change these.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1008_Sy_SEA.pdf?alt=media&token=0fa423fe-8b68-4629-9386-4e829e7a1abb)",20210622,231000,20210623,0,mainauditorium,Main Auditorium,Americas/Asia/Australia,Symposium,597889fe-aeb4-11eb-8c53-1e00b921e125,d94f9774cca911ebb719
From bench to bed-side: Quantifying brain microstructure using multi-parameter MRI,"Kathryn Keenan, Christophe Phillips, Susie Huang, Christia Lambert","Bogdan Draganski, Nikola Stikov","**Computational anatomy using T1-weighted MRI data has provided many fundamental insights into the changes in brain architecture occurring in health and disease. However, understanding the biological basis underpinning these observations is far more challenging, often reliant on indirect comparisons between unrelated studies. Quantitative MRI (qMRI) allows to directly link in vivo MR contrast measures to tissue property changes and provides a powerful suite of non-invasive tools to advance the study of brain anatomy. qMRI maps have been successfully used to study development, plasticity, aging and disease. Whilst, compared to conventional anatomical imaging approaches, qMRI provides more stable measurements across sites and greater insight at the biological level, it is not without limitations. Differences remain across scanners limiting the potential of the technology, necessitating the underlying variability in proprietary hardware and software used by MR vendors to be addressed. This symposium will bring together advances in qMRI at the level of physics, processing, analysis and applications. Dr. Keenan (U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology) will introduce the qMR basics and resources for standardizing the field. Dr. Phillips (University of Liège) will discuss qMR analysis tools and how to interpret the results. Dr. Huang (Massachusetts General Hospital) will present clinical applications and opportunities for qMR in studying neuroinflammatory disease. Finally, Dr. Lambert (UCL) will discuss advances and applications in the study of early and pre-clinical neurodegeneration. Attendees will gain a comprehensive grounding in science of qMRI, an overview of state-of-the-art developments, and the opportunities to apply these techniques to their own research.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1073_Sy_Bench.pdf?alt=media&token=67f0f8ab-62f3-4285-a335-64fbef2669eb)",20210622,231000,20210623,0,symposiumhall1,Symposium Hall 1,Americas/Asia/Australia,Symposium,59789066-aeb4-11eb-80aa-1e00b921e125,d94e33facca911eb88e6
Identifying and reducing model bias in network neuroscience,"Manjari Narayan, Andrew Reid, Alexandros Goulas, Mikail Rubinov","Mikail Rubinov, Lucina Uddin","**Network neuroscience is a nascent field that analyzes large-scale brain networks constructed from modern neuroimaging datasets. The field seeks to discover fundamental organizational principles of structural and functional brain networks. To this end, network neuroscience studies conducted in the last decade have adopted increasingly sophisticated models to explain and predict the organization of brain network structure, function, evolution, development and disease.Network neuroscience has devoted considerable attention to data quality and analysis replicability. In contrast, the field has devoted little attention to the problem of model bias — the closeness with which network neuroscience models represent target neurobiological phenomena. This symposium brings together statistical, cognitive, computational and network neuroscientists to directly engage with this pressing but little explored problem. The symposium will broadly focus on the following questions: 1) What does it mean to understand the structure and function of brain networks? 2) How can we define and quantify model bias in network neuroscience? 3) How can we specify and select models with progressively smaller bias? The symposium will comprise four complementary talks that span statistical perspectives on model bias, causal inference of brain connectivity, as well as strong interdependence of structural and functional brain-network models. The presentations will be followed by an interactive discussion between panel members and symposium attendees. Overall, the presentations and discussion will emphasize diverse approaches to identifying and reducing model bias, and the importance of these approaches for genuine progress in network neuroscience. The speakers represent a diverse group of researchers from around the world and at various career stages.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1076_Sy_Ident.pdf?alt=media&token=9e385ac5-8484-44ea-8f88-61a9835cc813)",20210622,231000,20210623,0,symposiumhall2,Symposium Hall 2,Americas/Asia/Australia,Symposium,597876e4-aeb4-11eb-a076-1e00b921e125,d94e8cd8cca911eb92b4
Simultaneous MRI-PET imaging: recent developments and future directions,"Sharna Jamadar, Andreas Hahn, Christin Sander, N. Jon Shah","Sharna Jamadar, Gary Egan","**Commercial MRI-PET systems are now available, and it is estimated that about 70 such systems exist world-wide (Shah, 2019, The Royal Society of Chemistry, UK). One of the first applications of simultaneous MRI-PET, which aimed to exploit the complementary nature of MRI and PET (Villien et al., 2014), was published six years ago, and progress in this area is rapidly developing. As with any multimodal imaging method, the combination of modalities brings unique opportunities and challenges. The increased inferential power of multimodality imaging is often offset by unique methodological challenges. The presenters in this symposium are uniquely positioned to providing a practical overview of this area to interested researchers. The emergence of MRI-PET is of particular interest to members of OHBM, as it provides a unique window into brain function. We will explore three broad topics: haemodynamic & glucose uptake mapping, haemodynamic & dopamine mapping, and trimodal EEG-MRI-PET. Jamadar and Hahn will discuss simultaneous BOLD-fMRI and [18F]-FDG-PET, which simultaneously measure haemodynamic and glucose metabolic responses to neuronal activity. fMRI/FDG-PET not only provides a unique insight into the haemodynamic and metabolic responses, but also offers an opportunity to disentangle these components of neurovascular coupling. Sander will demonstrate how simultaneous BOLD-fMRI and dopaminergic PET can be used to localise brain activity and simultaneously capture the underlying molecular and receptor-specific dynamics. Lastly, Shah, the editor of the only book on this method, will demonstrate how MR-PET can be further extended with EEG-MR-PET trimodal imaging, as well as recent work pushing the boundaries of the method in 7T MRI.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1078_Sy_Sim.pdf?alt=media&token=a9bb9e31-2762-46ef-bb1a-463c91f6fe13)",20210622,231000,20210623,0,symposiumhall3,Symposium Hall 3,Americas/Asia/Australia,Symposium,59787d42-aeb4-11eb-b9e1-1e00b921e125,d94ee5e8cca911eba6ae
Stress sensitivity as a predictor of long-term vulnerability versus stress resilience,"Florin Dolcos, Indira Tendolkar, Shaozheng Quin, Fleur Duyser",Indira Tendolkar,"**Psychiatric disorders are caused and maintained by acute and chronic stressors individuals are exposed to throughout life. Biological psychiatry has a long tradition in understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of stress adaptation and maladaptation at all translational levels. At the human brain systems level, functional and structural imaging methods have allowed us to identify stress-induced brain changes. In this symposium we will present converging evidence from different cohorts in healthy samples, in high-risk samples and in psychiatric patients with one or more comorbidity. Firstly, we will identify stress sensitivity by means of multimodal imaging in cohorts of healthy children, adolescents and young adults. Next, we will introduce neurocognitive factors of resilience/vulnerability that influence responses to emotional challenges, as well as evidence for the effectiveness of interventions aimed at increasing resilience in clinical and non-clinical groups. Then we will share structural imaging data and measurements of early life adversity to disentangle the interaction with psychiatric comorbidity on the structural integrity of brain regions involved in emotion regulation. Finally, we identify the relationship of amygdala reactivity and a transdiagnostic neurocognitive marker of depression in psychiatric patients with neurodevelopmental and stress-related mental disorders to identify common and dissociating (mal-) adaptation factors. In sum, we give an overview how the susceptibility to stressful life events play a role in the development of psychopathology in the shorter and longer term also taking aspects of psychiatric comorbidity into account.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1018_Sy_Stress.pdf?alt=media&token=41bf32fb-7cfd-4ed3-b1f1-28583d5878e7)",20210622,231000,20210623,0,symposiumhall4,Symposium Hall 4,Americas/Asia/Australia,Symposium,59788398-aeb4-11eb-83c8-1e00b921e125,d94f3e9ecca911eb8e21

"Communication in brain networks: models, mechanisms, and applications","Caio Seguin, Bertha Vázquez-Rodríguez, Demian Battaglia, Amy Kuceyeski","Caio Seguin, Olaf Sporns, Andrew Zalesky","**Neuroimaging has extensively characterized structural and functional brain networks, but the processes linking these two descriptions of nervous systems remain poorly understood and a hot area of research. In recent years, network communication models have gained substantial attention as a framework to bridge the structure-function gap---communication unfolding on top of structural connectivity facilitates functional interactions between neural elements. As our understanding of neural information flow advances, the number of brain network communication models is quickly growing, with current conceptualizations of neural signalling ranging from routing protocols akin to engineered systems to diffusive spreading dynamics. In parallel, the number neuroscientific applications in which these models have found utility is also increasing. Examples of recent advances include functional and effective connectivity prediction, tracking of the spread of neurodegenerative pathogens, and modelling the impact of lesions on brain function and cognition.This symposium will provide attendees with a diverse picture of the latest developments in brain network communication research. Speakers will cover graph-theoretical models of network propagation (Caio Seguin), structure-function coupling (Bertha Vázquez-Rodríguez), dynamic models of functional connectivity and theoretical mechanisms of information routing (Demain Battaglia), and clinical modelling of disrupted neural communication and regional functional interactions (Amy Kuceyeski). Attendees will gain an appreciation of the state-of-the-art methods and models available to investigate brain network communication, how these techniques can be used to study structure-function coupling in health and disease, and how connectome signalling relates to the dynamics of coupled neural populations. More broadly, the symposium will promote a dialogue between different communities within the OHBM membership that approach brain network communication through complementary angles of investigation.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1022_Sy_Comm.pdf?alt=media&token=28c0fcf5-3e79-42d1-b582-e37be5d31c30)",20210623,151000,20210623,160000,symposiumhall1,Symposium Hall 1,Africa/Americas/Europe,Symposium,59789692-aeb4-11eb-9f9e-1e00b921e125,d955c200cca911eb995e
Innovations in Multimodal Data Fusion and Data-Driven Discovery in Population Neuroimaging,"Vince Calhoun, Lisa Nickerson, John Murray, Christian Beckmann",Lisa Nickerson,"**This timely symposium aims to provide a dive into multivariate data-driven unsupervised machine learning methods for multimodal data analysis that are of increasing importance in this exciting new era of population neuroimaging. Our presentations cover a range of topics that represent the latest developments in statistical methods for multimodal data fusion and how these methods can overcome the challenges and opportunties of large-scale population neuroimaging – from a survey of new state-of-the-art methods for data fusion and a deep investigation into two of the most popular methods for cross-modal data analysis, to data-driven identification of imaging confounds in large-scale datasets and a new scalable computational method for super big data fusion. Our symposium is very timely given the recent shift in our field to large-scale population neuroimaging to simultaneously map brain activation, functional connectivity, white matter microstructure and connectivity, and structural morphometry patterns that link to population health, behavior and function.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1092_Sy_Inn.pdf?alt=media&token=26280831-3a35-4354-94fa-52d3ebf1a7be)",20210623,151000,20210623,160000,symposiumhall2,Symposium Hall 2,Africa/Americas/Europe,Symposium,59789cd2-aeb4-11eb-8780-1e00b921e125,d9561bf6cca911ebbf62
Emerging research in infant neuroimaging: a Fit'ng overview,"Silvia Gini, Alexander Dufford, Lucille Moore, Marisa Spann","Dustin Scheinost, Brittany Howell, Lilla Zollei, Alice Graham","**Infant neuroimaging studies have unique potential to elucidate early brain developmental trajectories and how different experiences may alter these trajectories. With large-scale initiatives, like the Developing Human Connectome Project, the Baby Connectome Project, and the HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study, more and more researchers are joining this exciting field. However, despite the potential of and interest in infant neuroimaging, the overall field is still nascent and a relatively few infant neuroimaging talks have been presented at OHBM. Here, we offer four cutting-edge infant neuroimaging works, exploring a wide-range of topics. First, a systematic review presents an overview of different common space templates used in infant neuroimaging and how the lack of standards hurts infant neuroimaging. Next, we present two talks on individual differences in infant functional networks and connectomes. Finally, we present on how experienced discrimination of BIPOC, pregant women affects amygdala and hippocampus connectivity in their infants. By attending this symposium, researchers will gain a greater understanding of where the field of infant neuroimaging is heading.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1085_Sy_Emerge.pdf?alt=media&token=1c6c6668-5e78-46b5-ba68-e515c61d548a)",20210623,151000,20210623,160000,symposiumhall3,Symposium Hall 3,Africa/Americas/Europe,Symposium,5978a312-aeb4-11eb-89a6-1e00b921e125,d95674e8cca911eba18b
Spatio-temporal brain dynamics across consciousness levels in clinical and healthy populations,"Simone Sarasso, Janna Lendner, Athina Tzovara, Marzia De Lucia",Athina Tzovara,"**The quest for the neural underpinning of consciousness and the main organizational principles characterizing the neural dynamics in conscious and unconscious states represent one the most challenging and unsolved problems in science. In this symposium, we will present novel findings providing complementary evidence across varieties of unconscious states supporting the view that loss of consciousness is accompanied by global changes in intrinsic brain dynamics, such as perturbation of scale-free properties of the brain, changes in background non-oscillatory neural activity, and processing of bodily signals. The first presentation investigates the link between consciousness and complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in sleep, anaesthesia and patients with disorders of consciousness. The second presentation will quantify background neural activity to delineate wakefulness from states of reduced consciousness -NREM & REM sleep, anesthesia and epileptic seizures-, in scalp and intracranial EEG. The third talk will investigate how the coordination, complexity and background non-oscillatory properties of neural responses to external stimuli are affected by the loss of consciousness in acute coma, proposing markers of outcome prognostication. Last, the fourth talk will examine the link between heartbeat signals and auditory processing in healthy participants and coma, proposing a novel mechanism for processing the timing of auditory sequences in conscious and unconscious states. Taken together, these presentations will reveal the distinct role of background neural activity, complexity and bodily signals in supporting conscious processing in health and disease.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1035_Sy_Spatio.pdf?alt=media&token=6b607be2-7352-460f-b07e-af18ca9de0ca)",20210623,151000,20210623,160000,symposiumhall4,Symposium Hall 4,Africa/Americas/Europe,Symposium,5978a9a2-aeb4-11eb-a218-1e00b921e125,d956ce52cca911ebbc1e

Characterizing Brain Microstructure Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Towards In-Vivo Histology,Nikolaus Weiskopf,AmanPreet Badhwar,"![Nikolaus Weiskopf](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fphotos%2FNikolausWeiskopf.png?alt=media&token=2e293bc8-374f-4a5f-a50d-3a604020ce69)\n**Nikolaus Weiskopf** is Director of the Neurophysics Department at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany.  He is an expert in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods and their application to neuroimaging. Together with his collaborators, he pioneered neurofeedback based on real-time functional MRI that advanced from first experiments to clinical trials within less than 15 years. His current research focus is to develop functional and anatomical microstructure imaging using MRI, in order to study structure, function and their interplay at the microstructural level.  He received his PhD in neuroscience from the Graduate School of Neural & Behavioural Sciences and International Max Planck Research School in Tübingen, Germany. After a postdoc and holding different faculty positions at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging (Institute of Neurology, University College London), he was appointed as Director at the MPI in 2015. He is Honorary Professor at the University of Leipzig and the University College London, Adjunct Professor at the Medical University of Vienna and member of the Young Academy of Europe.\n**Understanding the normal and diseased human brain crucially depends on reliable knowledge of its microstructure. Until recently, the microstructure could only reliably be determined using invasive methods such as ex-vivo histology. I will discuss how an interdisciplinary approach developing novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition methods, image processing methods and integrated biophysical models aims to establish non-invasive quantitative histological measures of brain tissue. Example applications of this emerging field of in-vivo histology includes the mapping of cortical myelination and superficial white matter / U-fibers. I will also address major challenges to this ambitious goal including the validation of the in-vivo histology approaches.**",20210623,221000,20210623,230000,mainauditorium,Main Auditorium,Americas/Asia/Australia,Keynote,59770d68-aeb4-11eb-aa40-1e00b921e125,d95dc00ccca911ebb580

Neuroanatomy for Neuroimagers: Bringing a systems-level perspective to neuroimaging analyses,"Sofie Valk, Casey Paquola, Maedbh King, Andreas Horn",Mac Shine,"**The human brain is comprised of numerous circuits and systems that together interact to form the basis of cognitive function. While we have a variety of techniques to measure these patterns of organization, an appreciation of the basic neuroanatomical principles that together form the central nervous system is critical for understanding the complex patterns that we observe in our neuroimaging data. This workshop will introduce attendees to the basic organizational structure of the human brain. We will present neuroanatomical principles at both the systems and circuit level. Upon completion, attendees will have obtained a better understanding of the functional organization of the human brain, how it has been shaped over evolutionary time, and how the different neuroimaging signals from their experiments may relate to the underlying neuroanatomy. The flexibility of this topic means that attendees will develop insight into how to interpret diverse kinds of neuroimaging data, ranging from non-invasive structural and functional MRI or M/EEG in humans, to tract-tracing, at the systems and circuit level**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1031_Sy_Bring.pdf?alt=media&token=6a0a76f9-a6fa-4687-95c8-84264f3fe724)",20210623,231000,20210624,0,symposiumhall1,Symposium Hall 1,Americas/Asia/Australia,Symposium,5977729e-aeb4-11eb-b74d-1e00b921e125,d95e18f6cca911eb8e2e

Failure Five Ways Roundtable,"Cyril Pernet, Christophe Phillips, Aina Puce, AmanPreet Badhwar","Aina Puce, AmanPreet Badhwar","**Failure is an essential part of being a scientist. Failures occur during all stages of doing science - from conceptualizing ideas and theories, gathering and analyzing data, all the way to writing manuscripts/grants and managing reviewers. Dealing with and learning from these various types of failure is the key to becoming a successful scientist. That said, this is a difficult initial pill to swallow for those who are training as professional scientists or are coming into the field from other areas of life. In this ‘Failure’ Round Table we plan to address the 5 key areas where failures can occur and will devote discussion to how these can be: (i) successfully mitigated, and (ii) their outcomes used productively to further successful science in the lab.**\\n[Link to full description](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1090_Sy_Failure.pdf?alt=media&token=186fd7c3-e518-4731-b4c6-91c0514c00c4)",20210624,10000,20210624,20000,symposiumhall2,Symposium Hall 2,Americas/Asia/Australia,Roundtable,597dac54-aeb4-11eb-ae61-1e00b921e125,d963a442cca911ebbc14

She is a human systems neuroscientist who studies multimodal signals measured in the living human brain in order to identify biomarkers of neurological diseases and develop neuroprosthetics to interface with the brain\n**There are many ways to measure the human brain, with each measurement highlighting a different aspect of brain function. Intracranial EEG recording, with electrodes implanted in the human brain for clinical purposes, have many different characteristics, such as narrowband rhythms or spectrally broadband motifs. These mesoscale field potentials measure the aggregate signals from neuronal populations and there are many existing theories on the role of different signal properties in visual processing. I will discuss how the integration of fMRI and field potential measurements in combination with computational modeling, can contribute to our understanding of typical and pathological processing in the human visual pathways.**",20210624,141000,20210624,150000,mainauditorium,Main Auditorium,Africa/Americas/Europe,Keynote,59767952-aeb4-11eb-9315-1e00b921e125,d96cb05acca911eb880d

OHBM-DGKN Alliance: International Symposium on Network Reorganization after Stroke,"Christian Grefkes, Adrian Guggisberg, Steven Small, Nick Ward","Christian Grefkes, Steven Small","**Stroke is a leading cause of acquired, permanent disability worldwide. Although the treatment of acute stroke has been improved considerably, the majority of patients to date are left disabled with a relevant impact on functional independence and quality of life. The most critical driver of functional recovery post-stroke is neural reorganization. Here, neuroimaging techniques like fMRI and EEG have considerably advanced the understanding of the mechanisms engaged in neural reorganization and recovery of function. This symposium provides a comprehensive overview on recent developments in the field of stroke recovery using neuroimaging and non-invasive brain stimulation. Novel techniques like dynamic functional connectivity mappings, concurrent TMS-EEG assessments as well as fMRI- and EEG-based network parameter estimates allow new insights into how a stroke lesion interferes with the functional integrity of different systems of the brain. Likewise, the combination of neuroimaging and neurostimulation techniques allows a better understanding of how brain plasticity can be modulated in order to promote the reorganization of neural networks. The symposium will also highlight important caveats and limitations of current models, and finally close with possible solutions and future directions.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1075_Sy_DGKN.pdf?alt=media&token=253c0fd3-9a1f-4353-8ad7-0d4131568e17)",20210624,151000,20210624,160000,symposiumhall2,Symposium Hall 2,Africa/Americas/Europe,Symposium,5977dee6-aeb4-11eb-8f4a-1e00b921e125,d96d62accca911ebbede
Advances in functional neuroimaging of spontaneous thought,"Choong-Wan Woo, Adam Turnbull, Matthias Mittner, Aaron Kucyi","Aaron Kucyi, Julia Kam, Jonathan Smallwood","**Understanding the neural basis of spontaneous thought is an emerging question in contemporary cognitive neuroscience, which cuts across two of the most important issues facing the human brain mapping community. First, different features of ongoing experience emerge consistently at rest, making it critical to understand how these states contribute to measures in resting state analyses as currently performed. Second, contemporary studies highlight that the default mode network is a core feature of many different patterns of ongoing experience. Accordingly, a better understanding of spontaneous thought will inform both neural and cognitive perspectives on the role of the default mode network in human cognition. Our symposium will highlight important perspectives on both a dominant methodology (resting state) and a critical question regarding neural function (the default mode network). Attendees will learn how state-of-the-art analyses, such as predictive modeling and unsupervised learning, as well as experimental approaches that account for psychological context, reveal the neural bases of spontaneous thought.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1022_Sy_Advances.pdf?alt=media&token=01ef6511-828b-42bb-a2e7-b20030369bdc)",20210624,151000,20210624,160000,symposiumhall3,Symposium Hall 3,Africa/Americas/Europe,Symposium,5977f070-aeb4-11eb-bcad-1e00b921e125,d96dbc28cca911eb8a91
Diversity Symposium: Racial Bias in Neuroscience,"Sharlene Newman, Sade Abiodun, Yakeel Quiroz","Rosanna Olsen, Amanpreet Badhwar, Lucina Uddin","**OHBM initially launched a Diversity and Gender Task Force in 2017 to address the growing need to recognize and address multiple forms of inequity with respect to gender balance and geographical representation on the Council (https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/blog/you-spoke-we-l istened-steering-a-new-course-with-respect-to-g ender-equity). Since 2017, this initiative has worked towards tackling a range of issues surrounding underrepresentation at OHBM. The task force has grown and evolved into a Diversity and Inclusion Committee (https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/gender--diversity-committee.html) that meets regularly to ensure that the needs of the diverse OHBM community are adequately represented at all levels of the organization and in all of its activities. As neuroscientists, the OHBM community increasingly recognizes that some groups are historically marginalized in ways that ultimately hinder both social and scientific progress. One way to combat these issues is to expose them and openly discuss ways to address them. This third Diversity Round Table follows up on the success of our inaugural symposium in 2019 focusing on gender biases in academia (https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm/courses/12238/sections/15843/video_presentations/137799) and the second virtual symposium in 2020 focusing on neuroscience and the LGBTQ+ community (https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/blog/ohbm-2020-diversity-round-table-intersection-between-neuroscience-and-the-lgbtq-community). The goal of the 2021 symposium is to facilitate productive discussions on how racial biases affect neuroscience research as well as neuroscientists of color. This is one of many actions we have planned to pursue as outlined in our statement following the murder of George Floyd (https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com/blog/ohbm-statement-george-floyd-and-black-lives-matter). **\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1057_Sy_Diversity.pdf?alt=media&token=00d07098-1053-4b9a-b432-0afa621fffd4)",20210624,151000,20210624,160000,symposiumhall4,Symposium Hall 4,Africa/Americas/Europe,Symposium,5977f8fe-aeb4-11eb-880d-1e00b921e125,d96e1594cca911ebab0f

INS-fMRI: a method for mapping mesoscale connectomes in nonhuman primates,Anna Wang Roe,TBA,"![Anna Wang Roe](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fphotos%2FAnnaWangRoe.png?alt=media&token=e004642a-44cb-4aa7-8363-2291f1d7c76b)\n**Dr. Anna Wang Roe** (B.A. Harvard 1984, PhD MIT 1991) is the Director of the Interdisciplinary Institute of Neuroscience and Technology at Zhejiang University (www.ZIINT.zju.edu.cn). She is known for her studies in visual and somatosensory processing in primate cerebral cortex and for her development of multimodal neurotechnologies.  Her doctoral work under Dr. Mriganka Sur on the 'rewired ferret' preparation is a well-known paradigm for studying brain development and plasticity. As a postdoctoral fellow under Dr. Daniel Ts'o and Torsten Wiesel (Rockefeller University, Baylor College of Medicine), she applied intrinsic signal optical imaging methods to elucidate the organization of area V2 (the second visual cortical area) of the primate. Her first faculty appointment at Department of Neurobiology at Yale University produced a series of studies in which visual illusions were used to differentiate the roles of visual areas V1 and V2. She continued her pioneering work on primate cortex at Vanderbilt University (Professor in Psychology, Radiology, and Biomedical Engineering), and developed integrated approaches (anatomy, electrophysiology, optical imaging, fMRI, optogenetics, near infrared laser stimulation, behavior) to address questions on cortical organization. Her subsequent work at Oregon National Primate Research Center at OHSU focused on postnatal development of foveal vision. She is now full-time at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China and is pursuing the project ‘Columnar Connectome in Macaque monkeys’, a project she hopes will bring understanding of the architectural basis of intelligent systems. She has published over 120 peer-reviewed articles, organized numerous international conferences and symposia, and actively participates in review panels and editorships. In recognition for her contributions, she has received Sloan, Whiltehall, Packard Fellowships and has been elected member of the International Neuropsychological Symposium, as well as SPIE Fellow and AAAS Fellow.\n**Connectome projects have contributed enormously to our understanding of network-based brain function. Here, we present a novel method for establishing mesoscale connectomes in the macaque monkey, which utilizes focal (~0.5mm) near infrared stimulation and ultrahigh field fMRI. Connections are acquired rapidly, at large scale, and in vivo within single individual monkeys. Results from studies of cerebral cortex and amygdala are presented. These high spatial resolution roadmaps represent a conceptual change in our understanding of the structure and function of the brain and will significantly impact brain science, precision medicine, and AI.**",20210624,221000,20210624,230000,mainauditorium,Main Auditorium,Americas/Asia/Australia,Keynote,5976d034-aeb4-11eb-8972-1e00b921e125,d974a1e8cca911eb967b

"Imaging the Brainstem: Approaches, Challenges and Opportunities","Ruud Lucas van den Brink, Jan Willem de Gee, David Clewett, Heidi Jacobs, Veronica Miki-Marttunen","Veronica Mika-Marttunen, Beth Lloyd","**The past few years have witnessed renewed interest in the brainstem within the neuroscientific, neuropsychological and clinical fields. The brainstem hosts multiple structures that constitute key centers for arousal and consciousness, pain, autonomic function, and cortical neuromodulation. Brainstem structures present challenges when assessing their location and activity through neuroimaging methods in humans, making the use of standard preprocessing and analysis toolboxes and pipelines insufficient or inadequate. In spite of this, recent efforts have advanced the field and took it to a point where theoretical or conceptual postulates about the role of brainstem systems can be tested. Improvements in brainstem mapping have the potential to lead to a better understanding of its functional interaction with cortical systems, its relation to physiological signatures, its involvement in higher-order functions, and its prominent role in multiple psychiatric and neurological conditions. This symposium intends to give an overview of technical and neuroscientific state-of-the-art of brainstem imaging work by experts who have intensely researched brainstem systems in humans, with a particular focus on neuromodulatory systems. The program includes topics such as: technical approaches to the imaging of small structures, opportunities offered by high-field MRI, promises of brainstem-specific measures as biomarkers in brain disorders, assessment of brainstem nuclei activity during cognitive processes, and use of ocular measures to inform brainstem structures mapping. The symposium puts the brainstem in the spotlight and is intended for everyone who is interested in unveiling the brainstem’s fascinating mysteries.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1025_Sy_Imaging.pdf?alt=media&token=f0ad233f-472d-4a70-99d5-21068c185a02)",20210624,231000,20210625,0,symposiumhall1,Symposium Hall 1,Americas/Asia/Australia,Symposium,59783648-aeb4-11eb-bcd0-1e00b921e125,d97502becca911eb8f58
Learning from high-dimensional neuroimaging data,"Jae-Joong Lee, Qunfang Long, Robyn Miller, Jing Sui","Vince Calhoun, Jing Sui","**Current advances in brain imaging technologies have enabled image acquisition at faster rates and with increased resolution. Multiple accessible international brain imaging datasets online also facilitate the generation of neuroimaging big data. Neuroimaging data is itself high dimensional capturing complex spatiotemporal variation across multiple modalities. Learning meaningful summaries from these data using flexible models is a challenging, but critical, endeavor. The extraction of effective biomarkers of both healthy and disordered brains is complex but has the potential to lead to significant impact. This symposium will introduce cutting-edge, machine learning approaches across a transdiagnostic spectrum can be leveraged to (a) reveal connectivity movies - modeling fluidly varying patterns of functional integration for interpretably presenting and analyzing high dimensional dynamic processes via fMRI signal; (b) infer schizophrenia subgroups by subspace analysis that adaptively capture both the temporal and spatial variability of functional networks; (c) explain and estimate individual differences on moment-by-moment ratings of sustained pain based on a connectivity-based neuroimaging biomarker; (d) pinpoint the common and unique neural pathways that underpin similar symptoms across the autism spectrum, and longitudinally predict the risk for mental disorders in healthy adolescents using personality-guided MRI fusion. This symposium will highlight multiple innovative, data-driven frameworks and discuss how they represent a powerful means of extracting useful neural signatures in multiple aspects. Such approaches that try to represent complex change via meaningful data-driven summaries can inform us about the healthy brain as well as provide new insights into the mechanistic understanding of brain disorders.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1077_Sy_Learn.pdf?alt=media&token=a28c76d0-2fdb-4d18-96d5-1f4dc7353904)",20210624,231000,20210625,0,symposiumhall2,Symposium Hall 2,Americas/Asia/Australia,Symposium,5978426e-aeb4-11eb-aaff-1e00b921e125,d9755f28cca911eb89ee

PET Imaging of Brain Connectivity: Hype or Future?,"Aldana Lizarraga, Silvia Caminiti, Andreas Hahn, Joana Pereira","Arianna Sala, Igor Yakushev","**In the last decade, brain connectivity has become a dominant concept in neuroscience. Herewith, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has made an essential contribution to the delineation of t he human brain connectome. While fMRI measures neural activity through changes in cerebral blood flow, positron emission tomography (PET) captures relevant biological processes in a more direct way, through the measurement of e.g., glucose metabolism, neurotransmission, and pathological protein aggregation. Emerging evidence indicates that PET is also able to provide valuable insights into brain connectivity. This symposium provides an overview of methods and applications of PET-based connectivity modelling in health and disease, highlighting its advantages and limitations. Given an increasing pool of publicly available PET data, the presented concepts might be of interest to the broad community of MRI researchers. We conclude that along with fMRI and diffusion imaging, PET represents a valuable tool for exploration of brain connectivity.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1062_sy_PETupdate.pdf?alt=media&token=813aba5b-9014-48a0-8d42-6cfe8a052e33)",20210624,231000,20210625,0,symposiumhall4,Symposium Hall 4,Americas/Asia/Australia,Symposium,59785024-aeb4-11eb-af97-1e00b921e125,d9761468cca911ebaaea

How can scientists respond to the climate emergency? A guide from the SEA SIG,"Charlotte Rae, Anne Urai, Adam Aron, Clare Kelly",Charlotte Rae,"**To keep the world at 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels we have a remaining carbon budget of 300 Gt of C02. Yet existing and pledged fossil fuel infrastructure and business-as-usual activities such as large academic meetings already commit us to 842 Gt C02 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1364-3). We either have to do something very dramatic to change our ways, or we have to anticipate a substantially warmer world, perhaps emerging as soon as the 2040s (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07586-5). By that point, the standard operation of our academic fields might be disrupted out of recognition. People are waking up to the growing international consensus that we need urgent action to tackle dangerous climate change and ecosystem degradation; including many of our members, who increasingly recognise that neuroimaging research activities play a part in these crises, from liquid helium extracted through fossil fuel production, to the energy usage of big data analysis. The annual meeting also has a substantial environmental impact, with the huge carbon footprint of flying, and conference centre practises such as single-use plastics. A primary objective of the SEA SIG is to educate our community on the environmental impacts of neuroimaging research activities, and of the annual meeting, and crucially, to foster discussion on, and make recommendations for, how we could change these.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1008_Sy_SEA.pdf?alt=media&token=0fa423fe-8b68-4629-9386-4e829e7a1abb)",20210625,151000,20210625,160000,mainauditorium,Main Auditorium,Africa/Americas/Europe,Symposium,59786a82-aeb4-11eb-900a-1e00b921e125,d97d5deccca911ebb022
From bench to bed-side: Quantifying brain microstructure using multi-parameter MRI,"Kathryn Keenan, Christophe Phillips, Susie Huang, Christia Lambert","Bogdan Draganski, Nikola Stikov","**Computational anatomy using T1-weighted MRI data has provided many fundamental insights into the changes in brain architecture occurring in health and disease. However, understanding the biological basis underpinning these observations is far more challenging, often reliant on indirect comparisons between unrelated studies. Quantitative MRI (qMRI) allows to directly link in vivo MR contrast measures to tissue property changes and provides a powerful suite of non-invasive tools to advance the study of brain anatomy. qMRI maps have been successfully used to study development, plasticity, aging and disease. Whilst, compared to conventional anatomical imaging approaches, qMRI provides more stable measurements across sites and greater insight at the biological level, it is not without limitations. Differences remain across scanners limiting the potential of the technology, necessitating the underlying variability in proprietary hardware and software used by MR vendors to be addressed. This symposium will bring together advances in qMRI at the level of physics, processing, analysis and applications. Dr. Keenan (U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology) will introduce the qMR basics and resources for standardizing the field. Dr. Phillips (University of Liège) will discuss qMR analysis tools and how to interpret the results. Dr. Huang (Massachusetts General Hospital) will present clinical applications and opportunities for qMR in studying neuroinflammatory disease. Finally, Dr. Lambert (UCL) will discuss advances and applications in the study of early and pre-clinical neurodegeneration.

Identifying and reducing model bias in network neuroscience,"Manjari Narayan, Andrew Reid, Alexandros Goulas, Mikail Rubinov","Mikail Rubinov, Lucina Uddin","**Network neuroscience is a nascent field that analyzes large-scale brain networks constructed from modern neuroimaging datasets. The field seeks to discover fundamental organizational principles of structural and functional brain networks. To this end, network neuroscience studies conducted in the last decade have adopted increasingly sophisticated models to explain and predict the organization of brain network structure, function, evolution, development and disease.Network neuroscience has devoted considerable attention to data quality and analysis replicability. In contrast, the field has devoted little attention to the problem of model bias — the closeness with which network neuroscience models represent target neurobiological phenomena. This symposium brings together statistical, cognitive, computational and network neuroscientists to directly engage with this pressing but little explored problem. The symposium will broadly focus on the following questions: 1) What does it mean to understand the structure and function of brain networks? 2) How can we define and quantify model bias in network neuroscience? 3) How can we specify and select models with progressively smaller bias? The symposium will comprise four complementary talks that span statistical perspectives on model bias, causal inference of brain connectivity, as well as strong interdependence of structural and functional brain-network models. The presentations will be followed by an interactive discussion between panel members and symposium attendees. Overall, the presentations and discussion will emphasize diverse approaches to identifying and reducing model bias, and the importance of these approaches for genuine progress in network neuroscience.

Simultaneous MRI-PET imaging: recent developments and future directions,"Sharna Jamadar, Andreas Hahn, Christin Sander, N. Jon Shah","Sharna Jamadar, Gary Egan","**Commercial MRI-PET systems are now available, and it is estimated that about 70 such systems exist world-wide (Shah, 2019, The Royal Society of Chemistry, UK). One of the first applications of simultaneous MRI-PET, which aimed to exploit the complementary nature of MRI and PET (Villien et al., 2014), was published six years ago, and progress in this area is rapidly developing. As with any multimodal imaging method, the combination of modalities brings unique opportunities and challenges. The increased inferential power of multimodality imaging is often offset by unique methodological challenges. The presenters in this symposium are uniquely positioned to providing a practical overview of this area to interested researchers. The emergence of MRI-PET is of particular interest to members of OHBM, as it provides a unique window into brain function. We will explore three broad topics: haemodynamic & glucose uptake mapping, haemodynamic & dopamine mapping, and trimodal EEG-MRI-PET. Jamadar and Hahn will discuss simultaneous BOLD-fMRI and [18F]-FDG-PET, which simultaneously measure haemodynamic and glucose metabolic responses to neuronal activity. fMRI/FDG-PET not only provides a unique insight into the haemodynamic and metabolic responses, but also offers an opportunity to disentangle these components of neurovascular coupling. Sander will demonstrate how simultaneous BOLD-fMRI and dopaminergic PET can be used to localise brain activity and simultaneously capture the underlying molecular and receptor-specific dynamics. Lastly, Shah, the editor of the only book on this method, will demonstrate how MR-PET can be further extended with EEG-MR-PET trimodal imaging, as well as recent work pushing the boundaries of the method in 7T MRI.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1078_Sy_Sim.pdf?alt=media&token=a9bb9e31-2762-46ef-bb1a-463c91f6fe13)",20210625,151000,20210625,160000,symposiumhall3,Symposium Hall 3,Africa/Americas/Europe,Symposium,59785d6c-aeb4-11eb-9dfd-1e00b921e125,d97ca5d2cca911eb9253
Stress sensitivity as a predictor of long-term vulnerability versus stress resilience,"Florin Dolcos, Indira Tendolkar, Shaozheng Quin, Fleur Duyser",Indira Tendolkar,"**Psychiatric disorders are caused and maintained by acute and chronic stressors individuals are exposed to throughout life. Biological psychiatry has a long tradition in understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of stress adaptation and maladaptation at all translational levels. At the human brain systems level, functional and structural imaging methods have allowed us to identify stress-induced brain changes. In this symposium we will present converging evidence from different cohorts in healthy samples, in high-risk samples and in psychiatric patients with one or more comorbidity. Firstly, we will identify stress sensitivity by means of multimodal imaging in cohorts of healthy children, adolescents and young adults. Next, we will introduce neurocognitive factors of resilience/vulnerability that influence responses to emotional challenges, as well as evidence for the effectiveness of interventions aimed at increasing resilience in clinical and non-clinical groups. Then we will share structural imaging data and measurements of early life adversity to disentangle the interaction with psychiatric comorbidity on the structural integrity of brain regions involved in emotion regulation. Finally, we identify the relationship of amygdala reactivity and a transdiagnostic neurocognitive marker of depression in psychiatric patients with neurodevelopmental and stress-related mental disorders to identify common and dissociating (mal-) adaptation factors. In sum, we give an overview how the susceptibility to stressful life events play a role in the development of psychopathology in the shorter and longer term also taking aspects of psychiatric comorbidity into account.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1018_Sy_Stress.pdf?alt=media&token=41bf32fb-7cfd-4ed3-b1f1-28583d5878e7)",20210625,151000,20210625,160000,symposiumhall4,Symposium Hall 4,Africa/Americas/Europe,Symposium,59786410-aeb4-11eb-aa13-1e00b921e125,d97d01e4cca911ebab27

"Communication in brain networks: models, mechanisms, and applications","Caio Seguin, Bertha Vázquez-Rodríguez, Demian Battaglia, Amy Kuceyeski","Caio Seguin, Olaf Sporns, Andrew Zalesky","**Neuroimaging has extensively characterized structural and functional brain networks, but the processes linking these two descriptions of nervous systems remain poorly understood and a hot area of research. In recent years, network communication models have gained substantial attention as a framework to bridge the structure-function gap---communication unfolding on top of structural connectivity facilitates functional interactions between neural elements. As our understanding of neural information flow advances, the number of brain network communication models is quickly growing, with current conceptualizations of neural signalling ranging from routing protocols akin to engineered systems to diffusive spreading dynamics. In parallel, the number neuroscientific applications in which these models have found utility is also increasing. Examples of recent advances include functional and effective connectivity prediction, tracking of the spread of neurodegenerative pathogens, and modelling the impact of lesions on brain function and cognition.This symposium will provide attendees with a diverse picture of the latest developments in brain network communication research. Speakers will cover graph-theoretical models of network propagation (Caio Seguin), structure-function coupling (Bertha Vázquez-Rodríguez), dynamic models of functional connectivity and theoretical mechanisms of information routing (Demain Battaglia), and clinical modelling of disrupted neural communication and regional functional interactions (Amy Kuceyeski). Attendees will gain an appreciation of the state-of-the-art methods and models available to investigate brain network communication, how these techniques can be used to study structure-function coupling in health and disease, and how connectome signalling relates to the dynamics of coupled neural populations. More broadly, the symposium will promote a dialogue between different communities within the OHBM membership that approach brain network communication through complementary angles of investigation.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1022_Sy_Comm.pdf?alt=media&token=28c0fcf5-3e79-42d1-b582-e37be5d31c30)",20210625,231000,20210626,0,symposiumhall1,Symposium Hall 1,Americas/Asia/Australia,Symposium,5978b034-aeb4-11eb-8e9b-1e00b921e125,d981b146cca911ebba68
Innovations in Multimodal Data Fusion and Data-Driven Discovery in Population Neuroimaging,"Vince Calhoun, Lisa Nickerson, John Murray, Christian Beckmann",Lisa Nickerson,"**This timely symposium aims to provide a dive into multivariate data-driven unsupervised machine learning methods for multimodal data analysis that are of increasing importance in this exciting new era of population neuroimaging. Our presentations cover a range of topics that represent the latest developments in statistical methods for multimodal data fusion and how these methods can overcome the challenges and opportunties of large-scale population neuroimaging – from a survey of new state-of-the-art methods for data fusion and a deep investigation into two of the most popular methods for cross-modal data analysis, to data-driven identification of imaging confounds in large-scale datasets and a new scalable computational method for super big data fusion. Our symposium is very timely given the recent shift in our field to large-scale population neuroimaging to simultaneously map brain activation, functional connectivity, white matter microstructure and connectivity, and structural morphometry patterns that link to population health, behavior and function.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1092_Sy_Inn.pdf?alt=media&token=26280831-3a35-4354-94fa-52d3ebf1a7be)",20210625,231000,20210626,0,symposiumhall2,Symposium Hall 2,Americas/Asia/Australia,Symposium,5978b6c2-aeb4-11eb-971d-1e00b921e125,d9820dcccca911eb8475
Emerging research in infant neuroimaging: a Fit'ng overview,"Silvia Gini, Alexander Dufford, Lucille Moore, Marisa Spann","Dustin Scheinost, Brittany Howell, Lilla Zollei, Alice Graham","**Infant neuroimaging studies have unique potential to elucidate early brain developmental trajectories and how different experiences may alter these trajectories. With large-scale initiatives, like the Developing Human Connectome Project, the Baby Connectome Project, and the HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study, more and more researchers are joining this exciting field. However, despite the potential of and interest in infant neuroimaging, the overall field is still nascent and a relatively few infant neuroimaging talks have been presented at OHBM. Here, we offer four cutting-edge infant neuroimaging works, exploring a wide-range of topics. First, a systematic review presents an overview of different common space templates used in infant neuroimaging and how the lack of standards hurts infant neuroimaging. Next, we present two talks on individual differences in infant functional networks and connectomes. Finally, we present on how experienced discrimination of BIPOC, pregant women affects amygdala and hippocampus connectivity in their infants. By attending this symposium, researchers will gain a greater understanding of where the field of infant neuroimaging is heading.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1085_Sy_Emerge.pdf?alt=media&token=1c6c6668-5e78-46b5-ba68-e515c61d548a)",20210625,231000,20210626,0,symposiumhall3,Symposium Hall 3,Americas/Asia/Australia,Symposium,5978bd48-aeb4-11eb-a168-1e00b921e125,d9826a4ccca911eb9887
Spatio-temporal brain dynamics across consciousness levels in clinical and healthy populations,"Simone Sarasso, Janna Lendner, Athina Tzovara, Marzia De Lucia",Athina Tzovara,"**The quest for the neural underpinning of consciousness and the main organizational principles characterizing the neural dynamics in conscious and unconscious states represent one the most challenging and unsolved problems in science. In this symposium, we will present novel findings providing complementary evidence across varieties of unconscious states supporting the view that loss of consciousness is accompanied by global changes in intrinsic brain dynamics, such as perturbation of scale-free properties of the brain, changes in background non-oscillatory neural activity, and processing of bodily signals. The first presentation investigates the link between consciousness and complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in sleep, anaesthesia and patients with disorders of consciousness. The second presentation will quantify background neural activity to delineate wakefulness from states of reduced consciousness -NREM & REM sleep, anesthesia and epileptic seizures-, in scalp and intracranial EEG. The third talk will investigate how the coordination, complexity and background non-oscillatory properties of neural responses to external stimuli are affected by the loss of consciousness in acute coma, proposing markers of outcome prognostication. Last, the fourth talk will examine the link between heartbeat signals and auditory processing in healthy participants and coma, proposing a novel mechanism for processing the timing of auditory sequences in conscious and unconscious states. Taken together, these presentations will reveal the distinct role of background neural activity, complexity and bodily signals in supporting conscious processing in health and disease.**\n[Link to summary of talks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/sparkle-ohbm.appspot.com/o/assets%2Fsymposia%2F1035_Sy_Spatio.pdf?alt=media&token=6b607be2-7352-460f-b07e-af18ca9de0ca)",20210625,231000,20210626,0,symposiumhall4,Symposium Hall 4,Americas/Asia/Australia,Symposium,5978c3cc-aeb4-11eb-8636-1e00b921e125,d982c668cca911eb8d7e
